# Paylocity Benefits UI – Test Suite

This repository contains automated UI tests for the Paylocity Benefits web application, built with Playwright and TypeScript.

## 1. Prerequisites
Install the following on your machine:

- Node.js 18+ (with npm)
- Git (to clone this repo)

Verify your setup:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

### REQUIRED: Credentials and authorization token

Before running tests, you **must** set UI login credentials and an API authorization token in `config/env.json`.

- `userName` and `password` are used by the UI tests to log in.
- `apiAuthToken` is a Base64-encoded `username:password` string used by Playwright API helpers for employee CRUD operations.

Example:

```json
{
  "userName": "your_ui_username",
  "password": "your_ui_password",
  "apiAuthToken": "your_base64_encoded_token_here"
}
```

## 2. Install Node.js dependencies

From the project root folder `Paylocity-Benefits-UI`, install the required npm packages:

```bash
cd Paylocity-Benefits-UI
npm install
```

## 3. How to run the tests

You can run tests using Playwright's test runner.

### Option A: Run the full suite (default config)

```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Option B: Run a specific spec file

Because the application does not support two concurrent login sessions, run the positive and negative suites with different worker settings:

```bash
# Positive scenarios – run with a single worker to avoid session conflicts
npx playwright test tests/TestEmployeeBenefits.spec.ts --workers=1

# Negative scenarios – safe to run with more workers
npx playwright test tests/TestEmployeeBenefitsNegative.spec.ts --workers=4
```

## 4. Project structure (high level)

- `playwright.config.ts` – Playwright test configuration
- `package.json` – project metadata and dev dependencies
- `config/` – environment configuration (base URL, credentials, API token)
- `pages/` – Page Object Model classes for UI flows
- `tests/` – Playwright test files (positive and negative UI scenarios)
- `fixtures/`, `locators/`, `utils/`, `test-data/` – shared UI test logic, locators, helpers, and data
- `playwright-report/` – HTML report generated by the built-in Playwright reporter

## 5. Playwright HTML report

After running tests, open the Playwright HTML report with:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

This launches an interactive HTML report from the `playwright-report/` folder.
